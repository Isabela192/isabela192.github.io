Welcome! My name is **Isabela**, I'm a meteorologist by formation and a programmer for, I like to believe, vocation. 

If you came here looking for a well-themed, well-structured blog where things make sense... Sorry, go back ðŸ˜¢

This blog has a little bit of everything. I hope that you find something interesting.

I'm currently working at IBM as a Software developer. My main fields of action are developing REST APIs with Python, and managing DB2 databases and some IBM cloud services.
