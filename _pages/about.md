My name is Isabela.

I'm a software developer currently working at IBM. 

I work with Python and SQL and have strong knowledge of Bash and R.
I am currently studying to become a FullSatck developer and learning JavaScript.
Recently, I acquired my first AWS badge, which you can check below.

My next step is to conquer the Solutions Architect and continue my adventure through the cloud.
This blog is a compound of personal insights and studies that I am doing. 

Feel free to check my posts or mail me at: isa.siq192@gmail.com
