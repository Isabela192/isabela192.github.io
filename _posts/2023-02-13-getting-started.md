# So the Year Already Started üéâ

I know it's February and maybe I'm kinda late to the New Year's resolutions party however, I finally got the courage to do what I've been planing for two years.

Back in *2020*, I wanted to make myself a website. Since I program in Python, I saw this as an opportunity to learn something new.

So I did what everybody usually does and bought myself a FullStack development course. Then proceeded to not take the course and feel bad about it. üòÑ

When I finally decided to take action, it was fun!
But then I would stop for long periods so the progress would be shorter every time.

When I got to the JavaScript section, I saw that this would take too much time and I would still not get what I wanted.

So I stopped again and let the project get dustier and dustier by the year.
Time skip to 2023, the project is still there, almost the same way it was two years ago.

Did I think that it would be way easier? Yes. But the thing is, the free options out there like Medium are not exactly what I wanted. This layout is still not 100% what I wish my blog would look like but it is something, you know?

I'm a convict procrastinator. This means that every time I set my mind to do something, I idealize that it will be this grand, perfect thing that everyone will love. So I would start to do it, got frustrated that it was not that easy, and stopped doing everything altogether.

I mean... I've been trying for more than five years to build a Pok√©dex and this project alone changed goals 5 times. Now I think that that project has a chance, but let's keep our hopes low.

At least now I'm writing this post in my blog to you, faceless reader üòÅ
I hope that you'll stick around to read all the things that I want to write about. 
And let's make 2023 a amazing year!

Cheers! ü•Ç
