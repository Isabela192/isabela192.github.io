# So the Year Already Started...

I know it's February and maybe I'm kinda late to the New Year's resolutions party however, I finally got the courage to do what I've been planing for two years.

Back in 2020, I wanted to make myself a website. Since I program in Python, I saw this as an opportunity to learn something new.

So I did what everybody usually does and bought myself a FullStack development course! Then proceeded to not take the course and feel bad about it.

When I finally decided to take action, it was fun!
But then I would stop for long periods so the progress would be shorter every time.

When I got to the JavaScript section, I saw that this would take too much time and I would still not get what I wanted.

So I stopped again and let the project get dustier and dustier by the year.
Time skip to 2023, the project is still there, almost the same way it was two years ago.
