## Why did I start this?

Back in 2022, my cat was killed by street dogs. That made me think: I needed to show the world how cute and amazing my cat was, so I started to code a blog. I wanted to do it all, from front to back and I failed miserably. So I found out I could just do a simple blog on Github using a plug and play framework, so here we are.

The problem is, since it was a blog made on GitHub using GitHub, I got caught on the idea that I should only post topics related to technology and started to study a lot just to post stuff here.

Unlike many people who work in tech, I'm not a huge fan of tech news and studying programming like crazy. I work as a software engineer in a kinda big company but the reality is that I'm not a huge fan of programming. I do this because it puts food on the table and is comfortable enough to be done from home.

Nonetheless, I still wanted to start a blog, so I did! And I started to study and I started to post and then I just forgot about it, because it wasn't fun and it was just too much work. It was so much work for me that I didn't post anything in 2024 and completely forgot about it. This is not an excuse is just me admitting that I couldn't commit myself to do this.

So for this year, I'll post about me! I'll show my baby cats and dogs and tell the world how adorable they are/were and tell their stories and I'll not care at all about this blog being on GitHub. This is my space and I'll use it as I want.

Today, I'll start with Alita!

## Alita's Story

Alita was abandoned by her mother on my roof. She cried for 4 days and 3 nights until we could finally convince her to get inside. She was weak, malnourished and, since she meowed the whole time, her voice became perpetually husky. 

We never had cats in my house, we didn't know what she needed or how to deal with her but we did our best to take care of her and tried to give her to adoption but nobody would want a "ugly" kitten like her.

This is how we got her:

And this is how she turned out to be:

She was feisty and had the strongest personality any cat could ever have. She would sleep on my chest wake up and bite me. She was the best cat anybody could have and I loved and still love her and will forever love her.

I'll talk more about my pets as I go but I feel like this is a starting point. I will still post about tech here and there but just because this is part of my life and kinda takes a lot of my time away.

But that's it, thank you! ðŸ«°
