## Another day, in another year...

I had planned a super interesting post about different women that changed the world somehow. I planned to talk about Cleopatra, that spoke more than five languages and granted more than 20 years of peace between Egypt and Rome while educating Julius Cesar to be a better emperor. Or Wu Zetian, the only female empress to rule China during the Tang dynasty.

Several women also changed science, like Ada Lovelace that created the first computer program back in the 1800s. There was also Grace Hopper that invented Cobol (yes that Cobol!) and invented the term **Debugging** because she found a bug inside her computer.

Sci-fi was also invented by a woman, Mary Shelley. She wrote Frankenstein to win a challenge made with her husband and friends. Even the first novel was ever written, Tale of Genji, was written by a woman! Her name was Murasaki Shibuki btw.

As you can see, women do a lot. And we put in a lot of effort, twice as hard to get half of the recognition.  Every day we deal with violence, payment inequity and less care from doctors. We are supposed to take the pain, take the work, and God forbid you to make a mistake or complain because then, every woman will be responsible for what you did.

And even with all that I still have to get up, go to work and do my job plus the job of other two men, receiving a sad payment for that while I hear things like: ‚ÄúThe only person that makes me angry is my wife‚Äù or ‚ÄúI'm angry, get X sister's here‚Äù. Like, really?! üôÑ

So on this march 8, what I want to say is: if you are a man, please, stand up for the women in your life. And women, stand up for yourselves. We all know the gaps we have in society, but it's 2023, why are these anti-women movements gaining a following? Why is the violence against women skyrocketing?

A society is built with both men and women, we need to unite and grow, not do what is going on now. I hope that some year I won't open the news website and only see awful statistics on this day. But right now, what I wanna do is take a rest because tomorrow we start all over again.
