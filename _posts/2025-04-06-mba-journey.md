## A new start 

When I graduated from College, everybody around me motivated me to take a master's degree in Atmospheric Sciences (my bachelor's). Since I didn't know what to do with my life, and I was already in the flow, I took the test... and passed in third place.

The thing is, I didn't like the end of my graduation, to be fair, although I like meteorology, academic life is a pain.
Everybody is competing to get something (?) and everybody is so arrogant. But I decided to take the test and it was my decision to start the course. All was my decision, the crippling depression that I got from it, was not.

By the end of the second year, I was extremely depressed, like bad thoughts depressed. It was around that time that I got my dogs and also landed my first job in a meteorology company. Things got kinda better, but when covid hit and I was working alone in my house every day I knew that I needed to either quit my job or quit my master's. I chose the latter.

The thing is, I wasn't happy with my research and didn't see any reason to keep working in an area that I not only didn't like anymore but also wasn't planning on making a living out of it. So I quit! 

A lot of people got mad at me, I was severed judged and basically burned the bridges with my college institution ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
But I never regretted that decision, not for one single moment of my life, and honestly, I don't think I ever will.

But a post-grad is always useful to keep you on the run for better jobs, so at the end of 2023 I decided to take an MBA course in Software Engineering. It started in November 2023 and now I'm in the final phase: the conclusion paper to get the degree.

I gotta be honest: I didn't put too much effort into this course. To be fair, in the beginning, I was really interested and excited to be studying again but the course itself was so... Boring. It felt like I was paying to get a simplified version of courses that I could take for free on YouTube. I'm not even exaggerating, I don't even watch the classes anymore and I'm still able to ace the tests... BTW, I'm not a computer genius.

So when the finals arrived I was half engaged, half bored. But I certainly was not going to give up again. So for my finals, I decided to do something that could help me in my career.

I proposed the following: analyze the effect of SOLID principles on the development of a banking application that uses the Design Patterns from GoF. 

Although it sounded easy in my head I wasn't expecting it to become such an ordeal. And that is what I plan to talk about in the next few days.
