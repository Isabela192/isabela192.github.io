## 2025 in a Glance

This year of 2025 felt like 10 years. I don't know why, but it felt like forever for the end-of-the-year to come around.
I started the year going to a HP exposition with friends that I would only see again in December.

I suddenly decided that I was going to run again, and ran a 5k in April, then decided to run a 10k in July, finishing the year running 15k in November.

I got a 10 in my MBA finals and got my certificate, now I can say that I have an MBA :)

I went to Germany and ran a 10k there in the middle of the mountains, that was nice. I went to Europa Park and had a lot of fun.

I vaccinated my cats, one of my cats got her teeth cleaned and I'm still struggling to get my dog's teeth cleaned.

I continued to take care of a stray cat and in November I found him dead in my street. I also rescued a 45 day old cat from the street and was able to find him a home.

I ran 300+ kilometers this year, lost a furry friend, got my mom to finally go to a doctor, and managed to deliver some very important stuff at work.

The company I work for is ending the remote work and will start with a 2 day ate the office routine x.x

I ran a cat teamed race and ran a ran with my dog as well. 

It was a year that a LOT happened and I was really tired and a little bit sad. I'm trying to be more positive this year and I want to do more stuff. I feel like I'm just existing and I really want to try more things. I just hope to achieve what I can in 2026 and that me and my family have a lot health to go along this year.
